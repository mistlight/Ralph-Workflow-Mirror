System tests verify behavior that requires real filesystem and git operations.
These tests are **NOT** part of the CI pipeline and run separately as sanity checks.

## When to Use System Tests

System tests are appropriate ONLY for testing **boundary implementations**:
- `WorkspaceFs` implementation (the real filesystem `Workspace` impl)
- Direct `git2` wrapper functions that interact with real repos
- File permission/symlink edge cases that cannot be simulated
- Cross-platform filesystem behavior differences

System tests are **NOT** appropriate for:
- CLI behavior testing (use integration tests with `MemoryWorkspace`)
- Pipeline logic testing (use integration tests with mocks)
- Application features (use integration tests)
- Anything that can be tested with `MemoryWorkspace` + `MockProcessExecutor`

## Allowed Patterns

| Pattern | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `TempDir` | Create isolated test directories |
| `std::fs::*` | Real filesystem operations |
| `git2` | Real git repository operations |
| `test_helpers::init_git_repo` | Initialize real repos |

## Running System Tests

> **Warning: System Tests Are NOT CI Tests**
>
> System tests are **NOT** part of CI. They are run manually for boundary validation.
>
> If you accidentally run system tests instead of integration tests, you'll see:
> - ~130 tests instead of 400+
> - Tests creating real git repositories
> - Potentially slow tests on disk
>
> **For CI/PR verification, always use:** `cargo test -p ralph-workflow-tests`

```bash
# Run system tests (not part of CI)
cargo test -p ralph-workflow-tests --test git2-system-tests

# Run with verbose output
cargo test -p ralph-workflow-tests --test git2-system-tests -- --nocapture

# Run specific test module
cargo test -p ralph-workflow-tests --test git2-system-tests -- rebase::edge_cases
```

## NOT Allowed

- Process spawning (`std::process::Command`) - use `MockProcessExecutor`
- Network calls - mock HTTP traits
- Tests over 1000 lines - split into focused modules

## Relationship to Integration Tests

Integration tests in `tests/integration_tests/` must use:
- `MemoryWorkspace` instead of `TempDir`
- `MockProcessExecutor` instead of real processes
- No `std::fs::*` calls

System tests are the exception where real filesystem operations are necessary
for testing git behavior that cannot be mocked.

## Parallelism: Why `#[serial]` Is Required

**All system test functions MUST be annotated with `#[serial]`** from the `serial_test` crate.

**Reason:** System tests create real `git2::Repository` objects. The `git2` crate wraps libgit2,
a C library that maintains a **global reference counter** via `git_libgit2_init` and
`git_libgit2_shutdown`. When multiple threads concurrently drop `git2::Repository` objects,
the global shutdown runs concurrently, which is thread-unsafe and causes **SIGABRT**.

`#[serial]` serializes test execution within the system test binary, preventing concurrent
`git2::Repository` drops and eliminating the SIGABRT crash.

**This is NOT a design problem** — it is an inherent constraint of the libgit2 C library. All
system tests that touch real git repositories require `#[serial]`.

**Usage:**
```rust
use serial_test::serial;

#[test]
#[serial]
fn my_system_test() {
    // real git2::Repository usage here
}
```

For inner modules (`mod tests {}`), also import `serial_test` within the module:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use serial_test::serial;

    #[test]
    #[serial]
    fn test_helper_function() { ... }
}
```

The `serial_test` crate is already a dependency in `tests/Cargo.toml`.

**Integration tests do NOT use `#[serial]`:** Integration tests use `MemoryWorkspace` and
`MockProcessExecutor` which are thread-safe, so they run in parallel for performance.

## Timeout Requirement

All system tests MUST use `with_default_timeout()` or `with_timeout()` wrapper
to prevent indefinite hangs, same as integration tests.
