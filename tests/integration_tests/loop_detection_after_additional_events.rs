//! Integration test for loop detection after additional events.
//!
//! Verifies that loop detection counters are computed based on the final state
//! after ALL events (primary + additional) have been processed, not just the
//! primary event. This is a critical fix to prevent incorrect loop detection
//! when additional events change phase, agent chain, or other state that affects
//! the effect fingerprint.
//!
//! # Integration Test Style Guide
//!
//! **CRITICAL:** All tests in this module MUST follow the integration test style guide
//! defined in **[../../INTEGRATION_TESTS.md](../../INTEGRATION_TESTS.md)**.
