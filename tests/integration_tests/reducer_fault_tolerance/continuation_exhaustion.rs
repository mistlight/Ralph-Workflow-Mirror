//! Integration tests for development continuation budget exhaustion and agent fallback.
//!
//! These tests verify that when a development iteration's continuation budget is
//! exhausted (due to repeated failed/partial status), the pipeline switches to the
//! next agent in the fallback chain rather than immediately aborting.
//!
//! # Integration Test Style Guide
//!
//! **CRITICAL:** All tests in this module MUST follow the integration test style guide
//! defined in **[../../../INTEGRATION_TESTS.md](../../../INTEGRATION_TESTS.md)**.
