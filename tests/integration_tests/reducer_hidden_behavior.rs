//! Tests documenting explicit reducer-driven behavior and the absence of hidden paths.
//!
//! These tests act as architectural documentation for the reducer-only pipeline:
//! - No handler-level "helpfulness" (cleanup, fallback, or retry loops)
//! - All retries, fallbacks, and phase transitions are driven by reducer events
//!
//! # Integration Test Style Guide
//!
//! **CRITICAL:** All tests in this module MUST follow integration test style guide
//! defined in **[../../INTEGRATION_TESTS.md](../../INTEGRATION_TESTS.md)**.
