//! Integration tests for diff failure fallback behavior.
//!
//! These tests verify that when `git diff` fails, the commit phase:
//! 1. Does NOT emit `DiffFailed` event (which would terminate pipeline)
//! 2. Uses fallback instructions instead of actual diff content
//! 3. Allows AI agent to investigate and skip commit if needed
//! 4. Emits `CommitEvent::Skipped` when AI determines no commit needed
//!
//! # Integration Test Style Guide
//!
//! **CRITICAL:** All tests in this module MUST follow the integration test style guide
//! defined in **[INTEGRATION_TESTS.md](../../INTEGRATION_TESTS.md)**.
//!
//! Key principles applied in this module:
//! - Tests verify **observable behavior** via effect capture
//! - Uses `MockAppEffectHandler` AND `MockEffectHandler` for git/filesystem isolation
//! - NO `TempDir`, `std::fs`, or real git operations
//! - Tests are deterministic and verify effects, not real filesystem state
