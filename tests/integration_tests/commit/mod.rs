//! Integration tests for commit message generation.
//!
//! These tests verify that:
//! - Commit messages are generated when developer_iters=0
//! - CreateCommit effect is called correctly at the reducer layer
//! - The commit message fallback system works
//! - Diff failure fallback behavior (ralph-skip support)
//! - Pre-termination commit safety checks
//!
//! Note: Tests that specifically test LLM commit message generation behavior
//! require the commit agent to run and cannot be properly tested without the
//! AgentExecutor trait infrastructure. These tests focus on the observable
//! behavior of commit effect creation.
//!
//! # Integration Test Style Guide
//!
//! **CRITICAL:** All tests in this module MUST follow the integration test style guide
//! defined in **[INTEGRATION_TESTS.md](../../INTEGRATION_TESTS.md)**.
//!
//! Key principles applied in this module:
//! - Tests verify **observable behavior** via effect capture
//! - Uses `MockAppEffectHandler` AND `MockEffectHandler` for git/filesystem isolation
//! - NO `TempDir`, `std::fs`, or real git operations
//! - Tests are deterministic and verify effects, not real filesystem state
