/// Regression test for infinite continuation loop bug (wt-39).
///
/// # Bug Description
///
/// When `max_dev_continuations` is missing from config (relying on default value of 2,
/// yielding `max_continue_count` = 3), the system allowed continuations to proceed indefinitely
/// when work status remained non-Complete (e.g., always Partial or Failed).
///
/// # Root Cause
///
/// The defensive check in `trigger_continuation` (budget.rs:137-147) incremented the counter
/// BEFORE checking the boundary, allowing the counter to reach the max value instead of staying
/// below it. This off-by-one bug caused the system to allow one extra attempt beyond the limit.
///
/// # Fix
///
/// The boundary check was moved BEFORE the counter increment (budget.rs:138-147), ensuring the
/// counter stays at 2 when the defensive check triggers, not 3. The `OutcomeApplied` exhaustion
/// check (iteration_reducer.rs:169-180) detects exhaustion via `(attempt + 1 >= max)`, which
/// correctly identifies that the next attempt would exceed the budget.
///
/// # Test Strategy
///
/// This test simulates the exact scenario from the bug report:
/// 1. Config has `max_dev_continuations` = None, defaulting to 2 (`max_continue_count` = 3)
/// 2. Every attempt returns Partial status (never Complete)
/// 3. Verify continuation stops after exactly 3 attempts (0, 1, 2), not indefinitely
///
/// The test tracks total attempts and uses a safety limit to prevent an actual infinite loop
/// in the test itself. Before the fix, this test would fail because the counter would continue
/// past 3 attempts.
