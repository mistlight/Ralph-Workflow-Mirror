//! Per-attempt logging infrastructure for commit message generation.
//!
//! This module provides detailed logging for each commit generation attempt,
//! creating a clear audit trail for debugging parsing failures. Each attempt
//! produces a unique numbered log file that captures:
//! - Prompt information
//! - Raw agent output
//! - All extraction attempts with reasons
//! - Validation results
//! - Final outcome
//!
//! Log files are organized by session to prevent overwrites and allow
//! comparison across multiple attempts.
