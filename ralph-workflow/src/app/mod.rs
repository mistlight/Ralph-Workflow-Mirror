//! Application entrypoint and pipeline orchestration.
//!
//! This module is the CLI layer operating **before the repository root is known**.
//! It uses [`AppEffect`][effect::AppEffect] for side effects, which is distinct from
//! [`Effect`][crate::reducer::effect::Effect] used after repo root discovery.
//!
//! # Two Effect Layers
//!
//! Ralph has two distinct effect types (see also [`crate`] documentation):
//!
//! | Layer | When | Filesystem Access |
//! |-------|------|-------------------|
//! | `AppEffect` (this module) | Before repo root known | `std::fs` directly |
//! | `Effect` ([`crate::reducer`]) | After repo root known | Via [`Workspace`][crate::workspace::Workspace] |
//!
//! These layers must never mix: `AppEffect` handlers cannot use `Workspace`.
