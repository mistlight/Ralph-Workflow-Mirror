/// Delta deduplicator using rolling hash and KMP.
///
/// Orchestrates the two-phase deduplication approach:
/// 1. Rolling hash for fast filtering
/// 2. KMP for exact verification
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// let mut dedup = DeltaDeduplicator::new();
///
/// // Add accumulated content
/// dedup.add_accumulated("Hello World");
///
/// // Check if a delta is a duplicate
/// if let Some(new_portion) = dedup.extract_new_content("Hello World!") {
///     // "!" is the new portion
///     assert_eq!(new_portion, "!");
