//! Commit input materialization and diff checking.
//!
//! This module handles preparing inputs for commit message generation:
//! - Reading git diff from workspace
//! - Truncating diff to model budget limits
//! - Materializing diff as inline or file reference
//! - Computing content hashes for cache invalidation
//!
//! ## Diff Failure Fallback
//!
//! When `git diff` fails (filesystem error, corrupted git state, I/O failure),
//! the handler does NOT emit `DiffFailed` or terminate. Instead, it uses fallback
//! instructions that tell the AI agent to investigate what changed:
//! - Run `git status` to see modified files
//! - Examine file contents directly
//! - Generate commit message based on findings
//! - Use `<ralph-skip>` if no changes found
//!
//! This ensures work is never lost due to diff computation failures.
//!
//! ## Model Budget Management
//!
//! Large diffs are truncated to fit within the model's context window:
//! - Compute effective model budget from agent configuration
//! - Truncate diff if it exceeds model budget
//! - Write truncated diff to `.agent/tmp/commit_diff.model_safe.txt`
//! - Emit events tracking truncation for observability
//!
//! ## Inline vs File Reference
//!
//! Small diffs are embedded inline in prompts; large diffs are passed by reference:
//! - Inline budget: 32KB (`MAX_INLINE_CONTENT_SIZE`)
//! - Below inline budget → `PromptInputRepresentation::Inline`
//! - Above inline budget → `PromptInputRepresentation::FileReference`
//!
//! ## Diff Checking
//!
//! Before materializing, check if there are staged changes to commit:
//! - Run `git diff` to get staged changes
//! - Write diff to `.agent/tmp/commit_diff.txt`
//! - Emit `commit_diff_prepared` with empty flag and content hash

The `git diff` command failed with error: {err}

You must investigate what changed by:

1. Run `git status` to see which files are modified/staged
2. Examine the content of modified files to understand what changed
3. Compare with recent git history if available (`git log -1 --stat`)
4. Based on your investigation, generate an appropriate commit message

If you determine there are NO actual changes to commit, respond with:
<ralph-commit><ralph-skip>Your reason why no commit is needed</ralph-skip></ralph-commit>

- "No staged changes found via git status"
- "All changes were already committed"
- "Only whitespace or formatting changes that should not be committed"
