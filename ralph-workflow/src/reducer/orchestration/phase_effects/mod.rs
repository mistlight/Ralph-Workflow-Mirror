//! Phase-specific effect orchestration.
//!
//! This module contains pure orchestration logic for determining the next effect
//! based on the current pipeline state. All functions are deterministic and perform
//! no I/O operations.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Each phase module implements a `determine_*_effect()` function that:
//! - Takes `&PipelineState` as input
//! - Returns an `Effect` to execute next
//! - Performs NO I/O or side effects
//! - Is purely deterministic
//!
//! # Priority Order
//!
//! The main `determine_next_effect_for_phase()` function is called by the
//! higher-level orchestration layer in `xsd_retry.rs`, which handles:
//!
//! 1. **Continuation cleanup** - Write pending continuation context
//! 2. **Retry logic** - Same-agent retry after timeout/failure
//! 3. **XSD retry** - Re-invoke agent after XSD validation failure
//! 4. **Continuation** - Re-invoke agent with continuation prompt
//! 5. **Normal progression** - Call phase-specific orchestration (this module)
//!
//! # Phase Modules
//!
//! - `planning` - Planning phase orchestration
//! - `development` - Development phase orchestration (including Analysis agent)
//! - `review` - Review phase orchestration (including Fix agent)
//! - `commit` - Commit phase orchestration
//!
//! # Special Cases
//!
//! - `FinalValidation` phase → `CheckUncommittedChangesBeforeTermination` (safety check), then `ValidateFinalState`
//! - Finalizing phase → `RestorePromptPermissions` effect
//! - `AwaitingDevFix` phase → `TriggerDevFixFlow` effect
//! - Complete/Interrupted phase → `CheckUncommittedChangesBeforeTermination` (safety check), then `SaveCheckpoint`
//!
//! ## Pre-Termination Safety Check
//!
//! Before any pipeline termination (Complete, Interrupted, or after `FinalValidation`),
//! the orchestration derives a `CheckUncommittedChangesBeforeTermination` effect to
//! ensure no work is lost:
//!
//! - If uncommitted changes exist → route to `CommitMessage` phase
//! - If working directory is clean → emit `PreTerminationSafetyCheckPassed` and proceed
//! - If git snapshot fails → route to `AwaitingDevFix` for recovery
//!
//! **THE ONLY EXCEPTION:** User-initiated Ctrl+C (`interrupted_by_user=true`) skips
//! this check because the user explicitly chose to interrupt. All other termination
//! paths (`AwaitingDevFix` exhaustion, completion marker emission, etc.) MUST commit
//! uncommitted work before terminating.
