/// # State Transitions
///
/// - `PhaseStarted`: Sets phase to Development
/// - `IterationStarted`: Resets agent chain, clears continuation state
/// - `IterationCompleted(output_valid=true)`: Transitions to CommitMessage
/// - `IterationCompleted(output_valid=false)`: Stays in Development for retry
/// - `ContinuationTriggered`: Saves context for continuation attempt
/// - `ContinuationSucceeded`: Clears continuation, proceeds to CommitMessage
/// - `PhaseCompleted`: Transitions to Review
