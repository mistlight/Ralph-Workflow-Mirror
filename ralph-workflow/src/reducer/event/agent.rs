/// rate limiting, and retry cycles. The agent chain provides fault tolerance
/// through multiple fallback levels:
///
/// 1. Model level: Try different models for the same agent
/// 2. Agent level: Switch to a fallback agent
/// 3. Retry cycle: Start over with exponential backoff
///
/// # State Transitions
///
/// - `InvocationFailed(retriable=true)`: Advances to next model
/// - `InvocationFailed(retriable=false)`: Typically switches to next agent (policy may vary by kind)
/// - `RateLimited`: Typically immediate agent switch with prompt preservation
/// - `ChainExhausted`: Starts new retry cycle
/// - `InvocationSucceeded`: Clears continuation prompt
