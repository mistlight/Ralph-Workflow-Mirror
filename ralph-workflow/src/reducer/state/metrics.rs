// # Where Metrics Are Updated
//
// Metrics are updated **only** in reducer code paths (`state_reduction/*.rs`):
//
// - `development.rs`: dev_iterations_started, dev_iterations_completed,
//                     dev_attempts_total, analysis_attempts_*, xsd_retry_development
// - `review.rs`: review_passes_started, review_passes_completed, review_runs_total,
//                fix_runs_total, fix_continuations_total, xsd_retry_review, xsd_retry_fix
// - `commit.rs`: commits_created_total, xsd_retry_commit
// - `planning.rs`: xsd_retry_planning
// - `agent.rs`: same_agent_retry_attempts_total, agent_fallbacks_total, model_fallbacks_total, retry_cycles_started_total

// # How to Add New Metrics
//
// 1. Add field to `RunMetrics` struct with `#[serde(default)]`
// 2. Update `RunMetrics::new()` if config-derived display field
// 3. Update appropriate reducer in `state_reduction/` to increment on event
// 4. Add unit test in `state_reduction/tests/metrics.rs`
// 5. Update `finalize_pipeline()` if displayed in final summary
// 6. Add checkpoint compatibility test
//
// # Checkpoint Compatibility
//
// All fields have `#[serde(default)]` to ensure old checkpoints can be loaded
// with new metrics fields defaulting to 0.

/// Run-level execution metrics tracked by the reducer.
///
/// This struct provides a complete picture of pipeline execution progress,
/// including iteration counts, attempt counts, retry counts, and fallback events.
/// All fields are monotonic counters that only increment during a run.
///
/// # Checkpoint Compatibility
///
/// All fields have `#[serde(default)]` to ensure backward compatibility when
/// loading checkpoints created before metrics were added or when new fields
/// are introduced in future versions.
///
/// # Single Source of Truth
///
/// The reducer is the **only** code that mutates these metrics. They are
/// updated deterministically based on events, ensuring:
/// - Metrics survive checkpoint/resume
/// - No drift between runtime state and actual progress
/// - Final summary is always consistent with reducer state
