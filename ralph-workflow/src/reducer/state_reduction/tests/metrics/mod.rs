//! Metrics tracking tests
//!
//! Verifies that RunMetrics counters increment correctly on reducer events.
//! Tests are split by metric category:
//! - `iteration_tracking` - Development and review iteration counters
//! - `retry_counting` - XSD retry, same-agent retry, and continuation counters
//! - `phase_transitions` - Phase-specific metric updates
//! - `summary_accuracy` - Final metric calculation and summary consistency
