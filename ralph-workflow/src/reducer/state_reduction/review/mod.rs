//! Review phase reducer.
//!
//! Pure state reduction for review and fix phases of the pipeline.
//! Handles events from issue detection, review validation, and fix application.
//!
//! ## Reducer Contract
//!
//! All functions in this module are PURE:
//! - No I/O (filesystem, network, process execution)
//! - No side effects (logging, environment variables, time)
//! - Deterministic: same state + event = same result
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The review phase uses a two-pass system:
//! 1. Review pass: Detect issues and validate XML output
//! 2. Fix pass: Apply fixes based on review feedback
//!
//! State transitions are driven entirely by events from handlers.
//!
//! ## Module Organization
//!
//! - `review_reducer`: Handles review pass events (issue detection, validation, pass completion)
//! - `fix_reducer`: Handles fix attempt events (fix application, continuation, budget exhaustion)
//! - `helpers`: Pure helper functions for state transitions
//!
//! See `docs/architecture/event-loop-and-reducers.md` for details on the reducer architecture.
