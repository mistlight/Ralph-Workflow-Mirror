//! Reducer function for state transitions.
//!
//! Implements pure state reduction - no side effects, exhaustive pattern matching.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The main `reduce` function routes events to category-specific handlers based
//! on event type, providing type-safe dispatch:
//!
//! | Category     | Handler                    | Responsibility                    |
//! |--------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
//! | Lifecycle    | reduce_lifecycle_event     | Pipeline start/resume/complete    |
//! | Planning     | reduce_planning_event      | Plan generation                   |
//! | Development  | reduce_development_event   | Dev iterations, continuation      |
//! | Review       | reduce_review_event        | Review passes, fix attempts       |
//! | Agent        | reduce_agent_event         | Agent chain, fallback, retries    |
//! | Rebase       | reduce_rebase_event        | Rebase state machine              |
//! | Commit       | reduce_commit_event        | Commit message generation         |
//!
//! Each handler is a pure function that takes state and its specific event type,
//! enabling compile-time verification of exhaustive matching within each category.

/// | Development  | reduce_development_event   | Dev iterations, continuation      |
/// | Review       | reduce_review_event        | Review passes, fix attempts       |

/// | Rebase       | reduce_rebase_event        | Rebase state machine              |
/// | Commit       | reduce_commit_event        | Commit message generation         |
///
/// Miscellaneous events are handled directly in this function.
