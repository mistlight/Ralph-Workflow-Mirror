//! Idle timeout detection for agent subprocess execution.
//!
//! This module provides infrastructure to detect when an agent subprocess
//! has stopped producing output, indicating it may be stuck (e.g., waiting
//! for user input in unattended mode).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The idle timeout system tracks two types of activity to detect whether an
//! agent is making progress:
//!
//! 1. **Output Activity**: A shared atomic timestamp gets updated whenever
//!    data is read from subprocess stdout OR stderr.
//! 2. **File Activity**: A tracker monitors AI-generated files in `.agent/`
//!    (PLAN.md, ISSUES.md, NOTES.md, commit-message.txt, .agent/tmp/*.xml)
//!    to detect file updates that indicate ongoing work.
//!
//! A monitor thread periodically checks both signals (by default every 30 seconds)
//! and kills the subprocess only if BOTH output and file activity have been idle
//! for longer than the configured timeout (300 seconds).
//!
//! Both stdout and stderr activity are tracked because some agents (e.g., opencode
//! with `--print-logs`) output verbose progress information to stderr while
//! processing, and only produce stdout when complete. Without tracking stderr,
//! such agents would be incorrectly killed as idle.
//!
//! File activity tracking prevents false timeouts when agents produce sparse
//! output but are actively writing files, which is common during planning,
//! commit message generation, and other file-intensive phases.
//!
//! # Timeout Value
//!
//! The default timeout is 5 minutes (300 seconds), which is:
//! - Long enough for complex tool operations and LLM reasoning
//! - Short enough to detect truly stuck agents
//! - Aligned with typical CI/CD step timeouts
//!
//! # Edge Cases and Behavior Notes
//!
//! ## Sparse File Updates
//! If an agent updates files very infrequently (e.g., once every 4 minutes),
//! the timeout detection will correctly recognize this as ongoing activity.
//! The 300-second recency window ensures that any modification within the
//! last 5 minutes counts as "active".
//!
//! ## Monitoring Cadence
//! The default check interval is 30 seconds, meaning file activity is
//! sampled every 30 seconds. This is much faster than the 300-second timeout
//! window, ensuring timely detection while remaining resource-efficient.
//! The check interval can be adjusted via `MonitorConfig` for testing or
//! special operational requirements.
//!
//! ## Performance Characteristics
//! File activity checking uses selective directory scanning:
//! - Only .agent/ and .agent/tmp/ are scanned
//! - Excluded files (logs, system artifacts) are filtered early
//! - Modification times are cached to avoid redundant disk I/O
//! - Impact on monitor overhead: typically <1ms per check on modern systems
//!
//! ## Timeout Reporting
//! When a timeout occurs, logs indicate whether it was due to lack of
//! output activity, file activity, or both. This helps users understand
//! whether the agent was truly stuck or if the timeout threshold needs
//! adjustment.
