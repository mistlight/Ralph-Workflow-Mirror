# Release: [Version Number]

> **How to use this template:** This template is for preparing and executing releases. It covers version bumping, changelog generation, tagging, and release validation.

## Goal
[Clear description of what's being released]

**Tips for a good release goal:**
- ✅ "Release v2.0.0 with new authentication system"
- ✅ "Patch release v1.2.1 to fix critical security issue"
- ❌ "Do a release" (too vague)

**EXAMPLE:**
```markdown
## Goal
Prepare and execute release v1.5.0 including the new search feature, performance improvements, and bug fixes from the past 2 weeks of development.
```

## Questions to Consider
Before releasing, verify:

**Readiness:**
- Are all intended changes included?
- Are there unintended changes?
- Have all PRs been merged and tested?
- Is the changelog complete and accurate?

**Testing:**
- Has the release been tested in staging/pre-production?
- Have critical user paths been validated?
- Have rollback procedures been tested?
- Are there known issues or limitations?

**Communication:**
- Who needs to be notified? (team, users, stakeholders)
- What documentation needs updating?
- Are there breaking changes to communicate?
- Is there a migration guide if needed?

**Risk Assessment:**
- What's the worst case if something goes wrong?
- Can we rollback quickly if needed?
- Are there data migrations or schema changes?
- What's the deployment strategy? (blue-green, canary, rolling)

- [Changelog updated with all significant changes]
