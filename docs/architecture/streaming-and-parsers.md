# Streaming and NDJSON Parser Architecture

This document describes how Ralph parses and renders streaming NDJSON output from agent CLIs (Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode). The goals are:

- real-time output when possible
- correct, non-duplicated output across provider quirks
- safe output in non-interactive environments (CI, pipes, logs)

## High-Level Data Flow

At a high level:

1. A byte stream arrives from an agent CLI.
2. `IncrementalNdjsonParser` extracts complete JSON objects without waiting for newline termination.
3. A provider-specific parser deserializes each JSON object into an event and routes it to handlers.
4. Streaming lifecycle + accumulation is managed by `StreamingSession`.
5. Rendering depends on terminal capability (`TerminalMode`).

## TerminalMode (What Can Be Rendered)

Streaming rendering is explicitly capability-gated:

- `TerminalMode::Full`: may use ANSI cursor positioning for in-place updates.
- `TerminalMode::Basic`: may use colors, but must not use cursor positioning.
- `TerminalMode::None`: must not emit ANSI escape sequences.

This is why streaming output is implemented in two layers:

- Per-delta renderers (Full mode): show in-place updates.
- Completion-boundary flush (Basic/None): accumulate deltas silently, then print once when the message/item completes.

If you add a new streaming path, ensure you also add a completion-boundary flush path for `TerminalMode::Basic` and `TerminalMode::None`.

## The Delta Contract (Non-Negotiable)

Streaming text events are expected to be true deltas (only newly generated text), not snapshots (full accumulated content).

If a provider sends snapshots as deltas and we render them naively, output duplicates exponentially. To prevent that, deltas must flow through `StreamingSession` so the contract can be enforced.

Current enforcement (see `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/streaming_state/`):

- snapshot-as-delta detection + auto-repair (extract only the new suffix when a strong overlap is detected)
- exact-duplicate / resend glitch suppression
- per-session metrics for debugging and hardening

Rule of thumb: do not bypass `StreamingSession` for streamed text/thinking/tool-input updates.

## Deduplication Between Streaming and Final Messages

Most providers emit both:

- many streaming deltas, and later
- a final "assistant" / "completed" message containing the full content

Ralph enforces: content shown during streaming must not be re-shown when the final message arrives.

Dedup is implemented using a mix of:

- message id suppression (when available)
- normalized content hashing (for providers that resend content without stable ids)
- per-(content-type, block-key) rendered-content tracking

When adding a new event type that represents a completion boundary, ensure it triggers the correct dedup and clears any per-key state needed to prevent double-flush.

## Streaming Lifecycle (Messages and Content Blocks)

Providers often structure output into message lifecycles and content blocks (for example: separate indices for text vs tool-use vs thinking). The session tracks this explicitly:

- message start: reset per-message tracking
- content block start: begin tracking a new block key (must not drop previously accumulated blocks)
- deltas: update accumulation and (in Full mode) render
- message stop / completion: flush accumulated content (in Basic/None) and finalize cursor state (in Full)

Key invariant: do not clear prior accumulated blocks when a new content block starts; non-TTY flush needs access to all blocks.

## Where This Lives in Code

- Incremental object extraction: `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/incremental_parser.rs`
- Terminal capability detection: `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/terminal.rs`
- Streaming session + contract enforcement: `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/streaming_state.rs` and `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/streaming_state/`
- Deduplication algorithms + thresholds: `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/deduplication.rs` and `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/deduplication/`
- Full-mode delta rendering (ANSI cursor strategy): `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/delta_display.rs` and `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/delta_display/`
- Provider parsers:
  - Claude: `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/claude/`
  - Codex: `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/codex/`
  - Gemini: `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/gemini/`
  - OpenCode: `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/opencode/`

## Testing Guidance

Most regressions in this area are output-duplication or terminal-mode correctness bugs.

- Prefer tests at the `StreamingSession` level for contract enforcement (snapshot repair, duplicate suppression, per-key behavior).
- Add at least one end-to-end parser test for any new provider event type that changes lifecycle or completion boundaries.
- Ensure `TerminalMode::None` paths never emit ANSI sequences.
