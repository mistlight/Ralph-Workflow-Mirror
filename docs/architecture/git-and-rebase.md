# Git and Rebase Architecture

This document explains how Ralph interacts with git repositories and why it avoids shelling out to `git`.

## libgit2 (No git CLI Dependency)

Ralph performs git operations via libgit2 through `git2`:

- Module: `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/`

This keeps behavior consistent across environments and makes unit/integration testing easier.

## Baselines: "Diff Since Start" vs "Diff for Review"

Ralph tracks a few baselines to keep prompts and reviews scoped:

- **Start commit baseline**: the commit OID at the start of a run.
  - Stored/loaded by: `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/start_commit.rs`
  - Used for: cumulative diffs for reviewer context (and "what did we change overall").

- **Review baseline**: a baseline per review pass.
  - Stored/loaded by: `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/review_baseline.rs`
  - Used for: incremental review depth modes and review prompts.

Diff helpers:

- `get_git_diff_from_start`: `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/repo.rs`
- `get_git_diff_for_review_with_workspace`: `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/repo.rs`

## Commit Creation

Commits are created deterministically by the pipeline (not by agents):

- Add all changes: `git_add_all*` in `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/repo.rs`
- Commit: `git_commit*` in `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/repo.rs`
- Identity resolution: `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/identity.rs`

Commit-message text is generated as part of the pipeline lifecycle (see `pipeline-lifecycle.md`).

## Git Wrapper and Hooks (Safety)

During agent phases, Ralph may install/enable mechanisms that prevent accidental commits by the agent itself and ensure consistent sequencing:

- Wrapper/marker management: `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/wrapper.rs`
- Hook management: `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/hooks.rs`

This is part of "keep decisions in reducers; keep I/O in handlers": agents should not mutate pipeline control flow by committing directly.

## Rebase Flow

Ralph can rebase onto the repo's default branch as part of unattended operation.

Primary code:

- Default branch detection: `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/branch.rs`
- Rebase engine + recovery: `ralph-workflow/src/git_helpers/rebase.rs`
- App-layer pre/post rebase orchestration: `ralph-workflow/src/app/rebase.rs`
- Checkpointed rebase state: `checkpoint::RebaseState` in `ralph-workflow/src/checkpoint/state/types/snapshots_and_phases.rs`

When conflicts occur, prompt building for conflict resolution lives in:

- `ralph-workflow/src/prompts/rebase.rs`

## Debugging Tips

- If a rebase is in progress, resume validation may refuse to proceed until the rebase state is consistent.
- If git wrapper markers/hooks are left behind, `git_helpers::wrapper` contains cleanup utilities.
