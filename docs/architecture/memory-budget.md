# Memory Budget and Resource Management

This document describes the memory budgets, limits, and expected resource usage patterns for ralph-workflow. It provides guidance for production monitoring and helps prevent unbounded memory growth.

## Overview

Ralph-workflow implements bounded memory growth to ensure long-running pipelines do not exhibit unbounded memory growth. This is critical for production deployments where pipelines may run for hours or days with hundreds of iterations.

## Memory Budget Baseline

Based on benchmark measurements from the memory safety test suite:

### Core Pipeline State

| Component | Expected Size | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Baseline pipeline state | ~100 KB | Without execution history |
| Execution history (1000 entries, heap) | ~51 KB | Default limit in memory (measured ~53 KB) |
| Checkpoint (serialized, typical) | ~300-400 KB | JSON with bounded history; file snapshots can increase size |
| Parser buffers | <1 MB | Event queue and streaming buffers |
| **Total per pipeline (typical)** | **<5 MB** | Depends on file snapshots and log buffering |

### Execution History Growth

The execution history is the primary source of unbounded growth. Without bounding:
- **Before bounding**: Linear growth (1 entry per agent invocation)
- **After bounding**: Bounded at configurable limit (default: 1000 entries)

**Growth characteristics**:
- Each execution step: ~53 bytes heap (in-memory), ~384 bytes JSON serialized
- 1000 entries: ~51 KB heap, ~375 KB serialized
- Unbounded (pre-bounding): grows linearly with iterations

## Configured Limits

### Execution History Limit

**Configuration field**: `execution_history_limit`  
**Default value**: `1000` entries  
**Location**: `ralph-workflow/src/config/unified/types.rs`

The execution history maintains a bounded ring buffer that drops the oldest entries when the limit is reached. This ensures:
- Recent execution context is preserved for debugging
- Memory usage remains predictable
- Checkpoint files stay reasonable in size

**Rationale for default (1000)**:
- Provides sufficient context for debugging (last ~100-200 iterations)
- Keeps memory usage under 1 MB for execution history alone
- Results in checkpoint files <5 MB in typical scenarios

**Configuration override**:

```toml
# ~/.config/ralph-workflow.toml
# (Optional per-repo override: .agent/ralph-workflow.toml)
execution_history_limit = 2000  # Increase for deeper history
```

**When to adjust**:
- **Increase** if you need deeper execution history for debugging complex failures
- **Decrease** if running on memory-constrained environments
- **Monitor** checkpoint file sizes - if they grow >10 MB, consider reducing

### Event Queue Capacity

**Implementation**: `BoundedEventQueue`  
**Capacity**: `1000` events  
**Location**: `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/event_queue/bounded_queue.rs`

The event queue implements backpressure to prevent unbounded buffering during JSON parsing.

### File Snapshot Thresholds

**Content threshold**: `10 KB` per file  
**Compression limit**: `100 KB` per compressed file  
**Purpose**: Prevents large files from bloating checkpoints

File snapshots larger than 10 KB are not stored in checkpoints to keep checkpoint sizes reasonable.

## Memory Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Bounded Execution History

**Implementation**: `PipelineState::add_execution_step()`  
**File**: `ralph-workflow/src/reducer/state/pipeline/core_state.rs:395`

```rust
pub fn add_execution_step(&mut self, step: ExecutionStep, limit: usize) {
    self.execution_history.push_back(step);

    // Enforce limit by dropping oldest entries.
    while self.execution_history.len() > limit {
        self.execution_history.pop_front();
    }
}
```

**Behavior**:
- Ring buffer semantics (oldest entries dropped first)
- Limit enforced on every insertion
- Maintains chronological order (most recent N entries)

### 2. Bounded Event Queue

**Implementation**: `BoundedEventQueue::new()`  
**File**: `ralph-workflow/src/json_parser/event_queue/bounded_queue.rs`

Uses `std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel` (bounded) instead of `channel` (unbounded) to apply backpressure when the queue fills.

### 3. Thread Lifecycle Management

All background threads are properly joined on shutdown to prevent resource leaks:
- File protection monitor thread: `src/files/protection/monitoring.rs`
- Streaming pump thread: `src/pipeline/prompt/streaming.rs`

**Exception**: Background monitor thread is not joined on panic (documented tradeoff for deadlock prevention).

### 4. Arc Reference Management

**Total Arc usages**: 880+ across codebase  
**Risk mitigation**: No circular references detected (verified by arc_patterns tests)

Common Arc patterns:
- Shared executors: `Arc<dyn ProcessExecutor>` (safe, no cycles)
- Shared printers: `Arc<dyn Printer>` (safe, no cycles)
- Cancellation tokens: `Arc<AtomicBool>` (safe, primitives)

## Production Monitoring

To monitor memory usage in production environments:

### 1. Track Checkpoint File Sizes

Monitor checkpoint files in `.ralph/checkpoints/`:

```bash
# Alert if checkpoint files exceed 10 MB
find .ralph/checkpoints -name "*.json" -size +10M
```

Expected sizes:
- **Normal**: 1-5 MB
- **Warning**: 5-10 MB (consider reducing execution_history_limit)
- **Critical**: >10 MB (indicates unbounded growth or config issue)

### 2. Monitor Execution History Length

Add instrumentation to log execution history length periodically:

```rust
if state.execution_history.len() > limit * 0.9 {
    warn!(
        "Execution history approaching limit: {}/{}",
        state.execution_history.len(),
        limit
    );
}
```

### 3. Memory Usage Alerts

Set process memory alerts:
- **Warning**: >500 MB resident memory
- **Critical**: >1 GB resident memory

Typical pipeline should stay under 100-200 MB for normal workloads.

### 4. Thread Leak Detection

Monitor thread count during pipeline execution:

```bash
# On Linux
ps -eLf | grep ralph-workflow | wc -l
```

Expected: Baseline + 1-2 background threads during execution, returning to baseline after completion.

## Benchmark Baselines

Established from memory safety benchmark tests (`ralph-workflow/src/benchmarks/`):

### Execution History Growth (per iteration)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Growth per entry (unbounded, heap estimate) | ~53 bytes |
| Growth per entry (bounded at 1000) | 0 bytes (after limit) |
| Memory for 1000 entries (heap estimate) | ~51 KB |
| Memory for 10,000 entries (unbounded, heap estimate) | ~530 KB |

### Checkpoint Serialization Performance

| State Size | Serialization Time | Checkpoint Size |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Small (10 steps) | <1 ms | ~8 KB |
| Medium (100 steps) | <5 ms | ~41 KB |
| Large (1000 steps) | <25 ms | ~375 KB |

**Note**: These are baseline measurements, not performance requirements. Actual times vary by hardware.

## Troubleshooting

### Checkpoint files growing unbounded

**Symptoms**: Checkpoint files >10 MB, increasing over time  
**Diagnosis**: Check `execution_history.len()` in checkpoint JSON  
**Resolution**:
1. Verify `execution_history_limit` is configured correctly
2. Check that `add_execution_step()` is being used (not raw `push()`)
3. Reduce `execution_history_limit` in config

### Memory usage increasing over time

**Symptoms**: Process RSS growing linearly with iterations  
**Diagnosis**: Profile with Valgrind or memory profiler  
**Resolution**:
1. Verify execution history is bounded
2. Check for Vec growth in other state fields
3. Review Arc usage for circular references
4. Check for file descriptor leaks

### Tests failing with OOM

**Symptoms**: Tests crash with out-of-memory errors  
**Diagnosis**: Likely unbounded growth in test scenario  
**Resolution**:
1. Ensure tests use `add_execution_step()` with limit
2. Reduce iteration count in tests
3. Add `#[ignore]` and run with `--release` for large tests
