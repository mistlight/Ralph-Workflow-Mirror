# Event Loop and Reducer Architecture

This document describes Ralph's pipeline event loop and reducer architecture: how `PipelineState`, `PipelineEvent`, and `Effect` work together, and the best practices that keep reducers pure and effects isolated.

If you are looking for the end-to-end lifecycle (Planning -> Development -> result verification -> Commit -> Review/Fix loops), see `pipeline-lifecycle.md`.
If you are looking specifically for effect-handler layering and filesystem rules (`AppEffect` vs pipeline `Effect`, `Workspace` requirements, `std::fs` exceptions), see `effect-system.md`.
If you are looking for per-run logging, event loop observability, and log directory structure, see `logging-and-observability.md`.
If you are looking for a codebase-level module map and entrypoints, see `codebase-tour.md`.

## Core Contract

Ralph's pipeline is driven by an explicit event loop with a strict separation of concerns:

- `PipelineState`: immutable snapshot of "where we are" (this is the pipeline's app-state).
- `Effect`: an intention to perform I/O (run an agent, write a checkpoint, run git, etc.).
- `PipelineEvent`: a fact about something that happened (success, failure, data produced). In code this is an umbrella enum that wraps category events.
- `Reducer`: pure function that applies an event to the current state.
- `Orchestrator`: pure function that derives the next effect from the current state.
- `EffectHandler`: impure executor that performs the effect and reports the outcome as `EffectResult` (primary reducer event + optional additional events + optional UI events).

The pipeline must make progress by cycling through these steps:

```
state --orchestrate--> effect --handle--> event --reduce--> next_state
```

### Why this is non-negotiable

- Predictable execution: the same state + the same sequence of events produces the same result.
- Testability: reducers and orchestrators test without filesystem, network, or git.
- Debuggability: the event log explains what happened without reverse-engineering control flow.
- Resume/checkpoint: state is the checkpoint; resume is just load state + continue.

## The Event Loop

At a high level (pipeline layer):

1. Orchestrate: inspect the current `PipelineState` and choose the next `Effect`.
2. Handle: execute the effect in the `EffectHandler` (I/O happens here).
3. Emit: return an `EffectResult` (primary `PipelineEvent`, optional `additional_events`, optional `ui_events`).
4. Reduce: compute the next state by applying the primary event and then any additional events, in order.
5. Repeat until the state reaches a terminal condition (`PipelineState::is_complete()`).

Two rules prevent subtle bugs:

- The event loop must not "fake" events for certain effects (no synthetic substitutions).
- The handler is responsible for the side effect itself; the reducer is responsible for decisions.

This includes checkpointing: `Effect::SaveCheckpoint` must still execute through the handler even when persistence is disabled. (If persistence is disabled, the handler can skip writing files, but the effect still runs.)

## PipelineState (The App State)

`PipelineState` is the canonical application state for the pipeline reducer architecture.

- It is the single source of truth for pipeline progress.
- It is the checkpoint payload: serialize to JSON to resume later.
- It is reducer-owned: state transitions only happen by applying reducer events.

### What belongs in state

State should include the minimum information needed to:

- deterministically derive the next `Effect`
- explain why the pipeline is in its current phase
- safely resume after interruption

In practice this means a lot of "single-task sequencing" fields (for example: "prompt prepared for iteration N", "xml extracted for pass P", "validated outcome stored", etc.). These flags keep orchestration deterministic and prevent handlers from bundling policy decisions into I/O.

### What must not be state

- mutable caches of external reality (filesystem, git status, network)
- hidden control flags that are not driven by events
- anything that would make `reduce(state, event)` depend on time, environment, or I/O

## Terminal State Semantics

The event loop terminates based on `PipelineState::is_complete()`, not on orchestration returning "no effect".

Current terminal semantics (see `ralph-workflow/src/reducer/state/pipeline.rs`):

- `PipelinePhase::Complete` is always terminal.
- `PipelinePhase::Interrupted` is terminal when either:
  - at least one checkpoint has been saved (`checkpoint_saved_count > 0`), or
  - we transitioned from `PipelinePhase::AwaitingDevFix` (completion marker already emitted).

The `AwaitingDevFix -> Interrupted` path is intentionally considered terminal even before the checkpoint write, because external orchestration observes termination via the completion marker. The event loop still ensures `Effect::SaveCheckpoint` runs next for persistence.

## Event and Effect Shapes (Current)

Ralph uses a few structural patterns that are important when you add new behavior.

### PipelineEvent is category-based

`PipelineEvent` wraps category-specific enums so the reducer can do type-safe routing:

- `LifecycleEvent` (frozen)
- `PlanningEvent`
- `DevelopmentEvent`
- `ReviewEvent`
- `CommitEvent`
- `AgentEvent`
- `RebaseEvent`
- `PromptInputEvent`
- `AwaitingDevFixEvent`

Category routing keeps each reducer module exhaustively matched within its own domain.

### UIEvent is separate from PipelineEvent

Effect handlers may emit UI-only events for rendering/logging. These do not affect state, do not go into checkpoints, and must not be required for correctness.

### Effects are intentionally "single-task"

Pipeline effects are granular (prepare prompt, invoke agent, extract XML, validate XML, write markdown, archive, apply outcome, etc.).

An effect should do one type of I/O and then report an outcome event. Avoid effects that mix multiple responsibilities (for example: invoke agent + parse output + transition phase).

## Non-Terminating Failure Handling: Escalating Recovery Hierarchy

The pipeline is designed to keep running and route internal failures through an escalating recovery hierarchy instead of exiting early. This ensures true non-terminating operation for unattended pipelines.

### Recovery Flow

When terminal internal failures occur:

1. **Transition to AwaitingDevFix**: Pipeline phase transitions to `PipelinePhase::AwaitingDevFix`
2. **Dev-fix invocation**: Orchestration derives `TriggerDevFixFlow` effect to diagnose and fix the issue
3. **Recovery attempt**: After dev-fix completes, the reducer determines the appropriate recovery level based on attempt count
4. **Escalating resets**: If recovery fails repeatedly, the system escalates through progressively more aggressive reset strategies
5. **Only terminate after exhaustion**: Completion marker is emitted only after all recovery levels are exhausted (12+ attempts)

### Escalation Levels

The recovery hierarchy implements escalating reset strategies:

- **Level 1 - Retry same operation** (attempts 1-3): Dev-fix agent runs, reset error state, retry the failed effect from the same point
- **Level 2 - Reset to phase start** (attempts 4-6): Clear phase-specific progress flags and restart the entire phase from the beginning
- **Level 3 - Reset iteration** (attempts 7-9): Decrement iteration counter and redo Planning → Development → Commit sequence
- **Level 4 - Reset everything** (attempts 10+): Reset to iteration 0 and start completely fresh from the beginning
- **Termination** (attempts 13+): Only after exhausting all recovery levels does the pipeline emit `CompletionMarkerEmitted` and transition to `Interrupted`

### Recovery State Tracking

`PipelineState` includes fields to track recovery progress:

- `dev_fix_attempt_count: u32` - Number of recovery attempts for the current failure
- `recovery_escalation_level: u32` - Current recovery strategy (0-4)
- `failed_phase_for_recovery: Option<PipelinePhase>` - Snapshot of the phase where failure occurred

These fields enable deterministic escalation decisions and are preserved in checkpoints to maintain recovery context across resumption.

### Recovery Events

The `AwaitingDevFixEvent` category includes events for recovery progression:

- `RecoveryAttempted { level, attempt_count }` - Recovery initiated at a specific escalation level
- `RecoveryEscalated { from_level, to_level, reason }` - Recovery escalated to more aggressive strategy
- `RecoverySucceeded { level, total_attempts }` - Recovery succeeded, clear recovery state and resume normal operation

### Why This Architecture

This escalating recovery design ensures:

- **Unattended operation**: Pipeline never gives up early, always tries progressively more aggressive recovery
- **Bounded attempts**: Hard cap at 12 attempts prevents true infinite loops
- **Minimal disruption**: Start with least disruptive recovery (retry) before escalating to more expensive resets
- **Deterministic behavior**: Recovery decisions are pure functions of attempt count and escalation level
- **Observable progress**: Recovery events provide visibility into escalation decisions

## Orchestration: Priority Order

Orchestration is a pure function from state to the next effect (`determine_next_effect(&PipelineState) -> Effect`). It intentionally encodes a priority order so that recovery/cleanup always preempts phase work.

The current priority ordering is documented in code (see `ralph-workflow/src/reducer/orchestration/xsd_retry.rs`) and includes, roughly:

1. Continuation context cleanup
2. Same-agent retry pending (transient invocation failures)
3. XSD retry pending (invalid XML output)
4. Continuation pending (valid output but incomplete work)
5. Rebase in progress
6. Agent-chain exhaustion / backoff waiting
7. Phase-specific effects (the normal single-task sequence)

Do not implement hidden retries or fallback loops inside handlers; retries/fallback must be reducer-visible state so the orchestrator can remain pure and deterministic.

## Handler Error Recovery (Downcasting)

Handlers normally return `Ok(EffectResult { .. })`. When a handler needs to surface a failure that should still be handled by the state machine, it returns `Err(ErrorEvent::... .into())`.

The event loop attempts to downcast typed `ErrorEvent` values out of `anyhow::Error` and re-emit them as a reducer event (`PipelineEvent::PromptInput(PromptInputEvent::HandlerError { .. })`). This keeps recovery logic in reducers without forcing new top-level `PipelineEvent` variants.

Handler panics are also treated as internal failures: the event loop catches them and routes through the same non-terminating failure flow.

## Debuggability: Event Loop Trace

The event loop keeps a bounded in-memory ring buffer of recent (effect, event, phase, retry counters) entries. When the loop encounters an internal failure or hits its iteration cap, it writes a trace to:

- `.agent/tmp/event_loop_trace.jsonl`

This is designed to make "stuck" pipelines diagnosable without reconstructing control flow.

## Where This Lives in Code

The exact file layout can evolve, but conceptually Ralph keeps these concerns separate:

- Event loop driver: `ralph-workflow/src/app/event_loop.rs`
- Orchestration (state -> next effect): `ralph-workflow/src/reducer/orchestration/`
- Reduction (state + event -> next state): `ralph-workflow/src/reducer/state_reduction/`
- Effects (intent enum) and handler trait: `ralph-workflow/src/reducer/effect*`
- Effect handler implementations (I/O): `ralph-workflow/src/reducer/handler/`

## Best Practices: Events vs Decisions

### Never add decision-events to lifecycle

`LifecycleEvent` is intentionally frozen so effect handlers cannot introduce new "control" events.

If you need to represent a new observation or failure, add it to the appropriate phase/category event and let the reducer decide what to do.

### Events must be descriptive facts

An emitted event should answer: "what happened" (and with what observable data), not "what should we do next".

Good events are:

- Past-tense, factual, and specific
- Stable over time (their meaning does not depend on hidden context)
- Carry the data needed for future decisions

Bad events are:

- Imperative or policy-shaped ("advance", "retry", "should")
- Encoding decisions that belong in the reducer

### Decisions belong in reducers (pure functions)

Reducers should encode the decision logic that turns facts into state transitions:

- retry vs fallback vs abort
- phase transitions
- iteration bookkeeping
- counters/limits
- which "next step" is enabled by state

The orchestrator then translates the resulting state into the next effect.

### Concrete naming guidance

Prefer events shaped like:

- `SomethingStarted { .. }`
- `SomethingSucceeded { .. }`
- `SomethingFailed { reason, .. }`
- `SomethingDetected { .. }`
- `SomethingCompleted { .. }`

Avoid events shaped like:

- `TryNextX`
- `ShouldRetry`
- `AdvanceToNextX`
- `DecideX`

#### Migration examples

Before (decision-shaped):

- `AdvanceToNextAgent`
- `RetryCommitGeneration`
- `SkipCheckpointWrite`

After (fact-shaped + reducer decision):

- `AgentEvent::InvocationFailed { role, agent, error_kind, retriable, .. }`
- `CommitEvent::MessageValidationFailed { reason, attempt }`
- `CheckpointPersisted` / `CheckpointWriteSkipped { reason }` (when you need observability)

In the "after" model:

- The handler reports the outcome (including classification data like `retriable`).
- The reducer updates state (advance chain, increment attempt, transition phase).
- The orchestrator sees the updated state and chooses the next effect.

## Best Practices: Reducers

Reducers must be deterministic and side-effect free.

- No filesystem, git, network, environment, time, randomness, or logging
- No mutation of shared global state
- No hidden coupling to config: decisions should be driven by values already present in `PipelineState` or carried in events

### Prefer typed error-events over `Err` when recoverable

When a failure should be handled by the state machine, represent it as a typed reducer event (often via `ErrorEvent` or a category event like `PlanningEvent::OutputValidationFailed`).

Reserve returning `Err` for truly unrecoverable failures. The event loop has a recovery path where certain handler errors are downcast back into typed error events and reduced.

### Reducer-friendly event design

If the reducer needs to decide something, the event should include the inputs to that decision.

Example: if fallback policy depends on whether an agent failure is retriable, the event should carry `retriable: bool` (or a structured `error_kind`) rather than forcing the reducer to re-derive it.

### TDD for reducers

When adding or changing reducer behavior:

1. Write a unit test for `reduce(state, event) -> new_state` capturing the decision.
2. Run the test and confirm it fails for the right reason.
3. Implement the minimal state transition in the reducer.
4. Add follow-up tests for edge cases (limits, phase boundaries, retries).

## Best Practices: Effects and Handlers

Effects are intentions; handlers are execution.

- Effects should be named as verbs/intents: `RunRebase`, `CreateCommit`, `SaveCheckpoint`, `InvokeAgent`.
- Handlers should not contain high-level pipeline policy (like "how many times to retry").
- Handlers should translate outcomes into events, not mutate pipeline state directly.

When a handler must implement a local safety rule (for example, "checkpointing disabled so do not write files"), it should still execute through the handler and return an event; the event loop must not bypass the effect.

## Migration Guide: From Decision-Actions to Descriptive Events

If you see control flow that looks like "if X then emit ActionY", it is often a sign the event model is too decision-shaped.

Recommended migration approach:

1. Identify the decision in the handler/orchestrator (retry, fallback, phase change).
2. Replace any decision-shaped event with a fact-shaped outcome event.
3. Move the decision into the reducer by updating `PipelineState` fields (attempt counters, chain position, phase).
4. Ensure the orchestrator derives the next effect only from state.
5. Add reducer unit tests that cover the policy explicitly.

## Loop Detection and Mandatory Recovery

The pipeline includes a loop detection mechanism to prevent infinite tight loops, particularly for XSD retry scenarios where the system cannot converge due to external mismatches (e.g., workspace vs CWD path issues).

### Loop Detection

The orchestrator tracks effect execution patterns in `ContinuationState`:
- `last_effect_kind`: fingerprint of the last executed effect
- `consecutive_same_effect_count`: counter for repeated identical effects
- `max_consecutive_same_effect`: threshold before triggering recovery (default: 20)

The effect fingerprint includes: phase, role, iteration, pass, and XSD retry state.

### Mandatory Recovery

When `consecutive_same_effect_count` exceeds the threshold and the phase is not `Complete` or `Interrupted`, the orchestrator emits `Effect::TriggerLoopRecovery`.

The loop recovery handler:
1. Resets XSD retry state (`xsd_retry_pending = false`, `xsd_retry_count = 0`)
2. Clears agent session ID to force fresh invocation
3. Resets loop detection counters
4. Emits `LoopRecoveryTriggered` event

After recovery, the orchestrator derives the next effect from the cleaned state, allowing the pipeline to resume with a fresh attempt.

### Why This Is Required

Without loop detection, the orchestrator's priority system (e.g., `xsd_retry_pending` always winning) can keep the system stuck in the same effect indefinitely. Loop recovery provides a deterministic escape path that preserves checkpoint/resume safety: the same pre-recovery state will always trigger recovery at the same threshold.

## Loop Detection and Recovery

Ralph includes a mandatory loop detection and recovery mechanism to prevent infinite tight loops (especially XSD retry loops when prompt paths are incorrect or files are missing).

### Loop Detection

The event loop tracks consecutive identical effects using a fingerprint based on:
- Current phase
- Current agent role  
- Iteration/pass number
- XSD retry status

When the same effect is derived more than `max_consecutive_same_effect` times (default: 20), the orchestrator derives a `TriggerLoopRecovery` effect instead.

### Recovery Behavior

The loop recovery handler:
1. Resets XSD retry state (`xsd_retry_pending = false`, `xsd_retry_count = 0`)
2. Clears agent session ID to force fresh invocation
3. Resets loop detection counters
4. Logs the recovery action

After recovery, orchestration derives the next effect from fresh state, breaking the loop.

### Design Rationale

Loop recovery is **mandatory** (not optional) because:
- External mismatches (CWD vs workspace root) can cause retry loops that cannot converge
- Checkpoint/resume cannot help when the same state produces the same loop
- The system must make progress even in degraded conditions

Recovery preserves determinism because it only resets retry state, not phase or iteration counters.
