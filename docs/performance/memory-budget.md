# Memory Budget and Performance Baselines

This document establishes memory budget expectations and performance baselines for the Ralph workflow pipeline based on comprehensive benchmarking and testing.

## Executive Summary

The Ralph pipeline implements bounded memory growth through a configurable execution history limit (default: 1000 entries). All memory safety tests pass, demonstrating:

- **Bounded growth**: Execution history does not grow unbounded
- **No memory leaks**: Arc patterns verified, no circular references
- **Thread safety**: All background threads properly cleaned up
- **Channel backpressure**: Event processing uses bounded channels

## Execution History Bounded Growth

**Implementation:** `src/reducer/state/pipeline/core_state.rs:395-403`

The `add_execution_step` method enforces bounded growth with configurable limits:

```rust
pub fn add_execution_step(&mut self, step: ExecutionStep, limit: usize) {
    self.execution_history.push(step);
    
    // Enforce limit by dropping oldest entries
    if self.execution_history.len() > limit {
        let excess = self.execution_history.len() - limit;
        self.execution_history.drain(0..excess);
    }
}
```

### Default Configuration

- **Default limit:** 1000 entries
- **Memory per entry:** ~53 bytes (heap allocation)
- **Total heap at limit:** ~51 KB for execution history
- **Checkpoint size at limit:** ~375 KB (JSON serialized)

### Growth Characteristics

| Iterations | History Entries | Heap Size (Estimated) | Behavior |
|------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------|
| 10         | 10             | ~530 bytes            | Linear growth |
| 100        | 100            | ~5.3 KB               | Linear growth |
| 1000       | 1000           | ~51 KB                | At limit |
| 10000      | 1000           | ~51 KB                | Bounded (oldest dropped) |

**Source:** Benchmark tests in `src/benchmarks/memory_usage.rs`

### Sliding Window Semantics

When the limit is reached, oldest entries are dropped using FIFO (First-In-First-Out):

- Entries 0-499 are dropped when adding entries 1000-1499 (with default limit 1000)
- Maintains most recent context for debugging and analysis
- Prevents unbounded memory growth in long-running pipelines
- Entries remain contiguous (no gaps in iteration numbers)

**Verification:** Integration tests in `tests/integration_tests/memory_safety/bounded_growth.rs`

## Checkpoint Serialization Performance

### Serialization Time by History Size

Based on benchmark measurements with actual execution history data:

| History Size | Serialize Time | Deserialize Time | Checkpoint Size |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 0 entries   | ~102 µs        | ~102 µs          | ~4 KB           |
| 10 entries  | ~170 µs        | ~163 µs          | ~7 KB           |
| 100 entries | ~900 µs        | ~720 µs          | ~41 KB          |
| 1000 entries| ~7.7 ms        | ~10 ms           | ~375 KB         |

**Source:** Benchmark tests in `src/benchmarks/checkpoint_serialization.rs`

### Serialization Scaling

Serialization time scales linearly with history size:

- **10 entries**: 171 µs → 7 KB
- **50 entries**: 476 µs → 22 KB
- **100 entries**: 833 µs → 41 KB
- **500 entries**: 3.9 ms → 189 KB
- **1000 entries**: 7.7 ms → 375 KB

### Round-Trip Performance

Serialize + deserialize (100 entries):
- Serialize: ~890 µs
- Deserialize: ~720 µs
- **Total**: ~1.6 ms

### Performance Characteristics

- Serialization time scales **linearly** with history size (no performance cliffs)
- Bounded history (1000 entries) keeps checkpoint size < 500 KB
- Round-trip (serialize + deserialize) completes in < 100ms for bounded history
- Memory per entry in JSON: ~384 bytes (vs ~53 bytes in memory)

## Thread Lifecycle Management

All background threads are properly cleaned up under both normal and panic conditions.

### Thread Usage Patterns

#### 1. File Monitor Thread

**Location:** `src/files/protection/monitoring.rs:357-366`

**Purpose:** Monitor PROMPT.md for unauthorized modifications

**Cleanup Strategy:**
- Stop signal sent on Drop
- Thread handle stored for cleanup
- **Documented tradeoff:** Not joined in Drop (might be panicking)

**Verification:** Integration test `test_background_monitor_thread_does_not_prevent_shutdown`

#### 2. Streaming Pump Threads

**Location:** `src/pipeline/prompt/streaming.rs:176-183`

**Purpose:** Pump stdout from agent process in real-time

**Cleanup Strategy:**
- 2-second deadline for graceful shutdown
- Detached if deadline exceeded (best-effort cleanup)
- Short-lived (bounded by agent process lifetime)

**Verification:** Integration test `test_streaming_threads_cleaned_up_after_agent_invocation`

### Thread Safety Verification

Integration tests verify thread lifecycle correctness:

1. **No hangs**: Pipeline completes without blocking (timeout wrapper detects hangs)
2. **No leaks**: 20 rapid start/stop cycles show no thread accumulation
3. **Clean shutdown**: All threads properly joined or documented as detached
4. **Panic resilience**: Error paths don't leave threads hanging

**Test suite:** `tests/integration_tests/memory_safety/thread_lifecycle.rs` (8 tests, all passing)

## Arc Reference Patterns

All Arc usage follows correct patterns with **no circular references**.

### Arc Usage Statistics

- **Total Arc matches**: 243 instances across 71 files
- **Nested Arc patterns**: 2 (both for `Arc<AtomicBool>` in monitor threads)
- **Weak references**: 0 (no intentional circular reference patterns)

### Common Arc Patterns

#### 1. Executor Arc (Process Executor)

```rust
let executor: Arc<dyn ProcessExecutor> = Arc::new(MockProcessExecutor::new());
```

**Usage:** Shared across pipeline phases for process spawning

**Cleanup:** Strong_count returns to baseline after pipeline completion

**Verification:** `test_executor_arc_cleanup_after_pipeline` (arc_patterns.rs:72)

#### 2. Workspace Arc (File System Operations)

```rust
let workspace: Arc<dyn Workspace> = Arc::new(MemoryWorkspace::new_test());
```

**Usage:** Shared workspace for file operations across pipeline

**Cleanup:** Strong_count stable, no accumulation across operations

**Verification:** `test_workspace_arc_cleanup_after_multiple_operations` (arc_patterns.rs:151)

#### 3. Monitor Thread Arc (Atomic Flags)

```rust
let stop_signal = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));
```

**Usage:** Shared stop signal between main thread and monitor thread

**Cleanup:** Dropped when monitor thread exits

**Verification:** Thread lifecycle tests verify no hangs

### Arc Safety Guarantees

- **No circular references**: No `Weak<T>` usage found in codebase
- **Proper cleanup**: Strong_count returns to baseline after use
- **No accumulation**: Multiple pipeline runs don't leak Arc references
- **Nested safety**: Nested Arc usage (Arc in Arc) verified safe

**Test suite:** `tests/integration_tests/memory_safety/arc_patterns.rs` (8 tests, all passing)

## Channel Backpressure

All channels use bounded capacity where appropriate, with documented exceptions for system channels.

### Bounded Channel Pattern (Recommended)

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;

// CORRECT: Bounded channel with capacity limit
let (tx, rx) = mpsc::sync_channel::<Event>(100);

// Backpressure: try_send returns TrySendError::Full when at capacity
match tx.try_send(event) {
    Ok(()) => { /* sent successfully */ }
    Err(mpsc::TrySendError::Full(_)) => { /* channel full, apply backpressure */ }
    Err(mpsc::TrySendError::Disconnected(_)) => { /* receiver dropped */ }
}
```

### Primary Bounded Channel Implementation

**Location:** `src/json_parser/event_queue/bounded_queue.rs:84`

```rust
let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::sync_channel(config.capacity);
```

**Usage:** JSON event processing queue (critical path)

**Capacity:** Configurable via `BoundedQueueConfig`

**Verification:** `test_sync_channel_applies_backpressure` (channel_bounds.rs:21)

### Documented Unbounded Channel Exceptions

#### 1. File System Notifications

**Location:** `src/files/protection/monitoring.rs`

**Usage:** File system watcher events (notify library requirement)

```rust
let (tx, rx) = std::sync::mpsc::channel();
let mut watcher = notify::recommended_watcher(tx)?;
```

**Justification:** Required by `notify` library API; bounded by file system event rate

#### 2. Short-Lived Stdout Pumping

**Location:** `src/pipeline/prompt/streaming.rs`

**Usage:** Stdout from agent process (real-time streaming)

```rust
let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
let pump_handle = spawn_stdout_pump(stdout, activity_timestamp, tx, cancel);
```

**Justification:** Short-lived (bounded by agent process lifetime); backpressure handled at reader level

### Channel Safety Verification

Integration tests verify bounded channel behavior:

1. **Backpressure applied**: `try_send` fails with `TrySendError::Full` when at capacity
2. **Proper draining**: Channels drain completely on shutdown
3. **High throughput**: 100-event test verifies producer/consumer pattern
4. **Capacity limits**: Tests verify limits from 10 to 1000 capacity

**Test suite:** `tests/integration_tests/memory_safety/channel_bounds.rs` (6 tests, all passing)

## Unsafe Code Verification

The codebase contains 4 unsafe blocks, all in `src/executor/real.rs` for Unix system calls.

### Unsafe Block Inventory

| Line Range | Operation | Purpose | Safety Justification |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| 16-24 | fcntl (F_GETFL, F_SETFL) | Set non-blocking I/O on file descriptors | Called with valid fd owned by this process |
| 40-42 | kill (SIGTERM) | Send SIGTERM to process group | Called with valid PID from child process |
| 53-55 | kill (SIGKILL) | Send SIGKILL to process group (forced) | Called with valid PID from child process |
| 164-171 | setpgid | Create new process group for agent | Called in pre_exec before child runs |

### Safety Verification Through Behavioral Tests

Rather than testing unsafe code directly, tests verify **observable behavior**:

#### 1. Non-blocking I/O (fcntl)

**Test:** `test_nonblocking_io_setup` (executor/tests/safety.rs)

**Verifies:** File descriptors are properly configured for non-blocking reads

#### 2. Process Termination (kill SIGTERM/SIGKILL)

**Test:** `test_process_cleanup_terminates_correctly` (executor/tests/safety.rs)

**Verifies:** Processes are properly terminated when requested

#### 3. Process Group Isolation (setpgid)

**Test:** `test_process_group_isolation` (executor/tests/safety.rs)

**Verifies:** Agent processes run in separate process groups

### Safety Test Results

All 6 unsafe code safety tests pass:

```bash
cargo test -p ralph-workflow --lib executor::tests::safety --quiet
test result: ok. 6 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

## Production Recommendations

### Memory Limits

Based on benchmark and test results, recommended configurations:

#### Default Configuration (Most Workflows)

- **Execution history limit:** 1000 entries
- **Expected memory usage:** ~51 KB (history) + ~375 KB (checkpoint)
- **Suitable for:** Typical workflows with < 10,000 iterations

#### High-Context Configuration (Debugging)

- **Execution history limit:** 2000 entries
- **Expected memory usage:** ~102 KB (history) + ~750 KB (checkpoint)
- **Suitable for:** Workflows requiring extensive debugging context

#### Low-Memory Configuration (Resource-Constrained)

- **Execution history limit:** 500 entries
- **Expected memory usage:** ~26 KB (history) + ~190 KB (checkpoint)
- **Suitable for:** Embedded systems or high-concurrency deployments

### Monitoring Metrics

Monitor these metrics in production to detect regressions:

#### 1. Execution History Growth

**Metric:** `execution_history.len()`

**Expected:** Should **plateau** at configured limit (e.g., 1000)

**Red flag:** Linear growth beyond limit indicates bounding mechanism failure

#### 2. Checkpoint File Size

**Metric:** Checkpoint file size on disk

**Expected:** Should stay < 500 KB with default limit (1000 entries)

**Red flag:** Checkpoint size > 1 MB indicates unbounded growth or serialization issue

#### 3. Memory Usage Over Time

**Metric:** Process RSS (Resident Set Size)

**Expected:** Bounded growth, should stabilize after initial pipeline setup

**Red flag:** Continuous linear growth indicates memory leak

#### 4. Serialization Performance

**Metric:** Checkpoint serialize/deserialize time

**Expected:** < 100ms round-trip for bounded history (1000 entries)

**Red flag:** Serialization time > 1 second indicates performance regression

### Regression Detection

To detect performance regressions, run benchmarks before/after changes:

```bash
# Capture baseline
cargo test -p ralph-workflow --lib benchmarks -- --nocapture > baseline.txt

# After changes, compare
cargo test -p ralph-workflow --lib benchmarks -- --nocapture > current.txt
diff baseline.txt current.txt
```

#### Red Flags

1. **Execution history grows unbounded** (> configured limit)
2. **Checkpoint size exceeds 1 MB** with default limit
3. **Serialization time exceeds 100ms** for bounded history
4. **Memory growth doesn't plateau** over iterations
5. **Arc strong_count doesn't return to baseline** after operations
6. **Thread count increases** across multiple pipeline runs

## Verification Commands

All memory safety tests can be verified with:

```bash
# Full memory safety verification suite
bash scripts/verify_memory_safety.sh

# Individual test suites
cargo test -p ralph-workflow-tests --test integration_tests memory_safety::bounded_growth
cargo test -p ralph-workflow-tests --test integration_tests memory_safety::thread_lifecycle
cargo test -p ralph-workflow-tests --test integration_tests memory_safety::arc_patterns
cargo test -p ralph-workflow-tests --test integration_tests memory_safety::channel_bounds

# Benchmark tests (informational)
cargo test -p ralph-workflow --lib benchmarks -- --nocapture

# Unsafe code behavioral verification
cargo test -p ralph-workflow --lib executor::tests::safety
```

**Expected result:** ALL tests pass with NO OUTPUT (no warnings or failures)

## Performance Baseline Summary

### Memory Growth

- **10 iterations**: 530 bytes heap
- **100 iterations**: 5.3 KB heap
- **1000 iterations**: 51 KB heap (at limit)
- **10,000 iterations**: 51 KB heap (bounded)

**Growth rate**: ~53 bytes per entry until limit, then plateaus

### Checkpoint Performance

- **Small state (10 entries)**: 170 µs serialize, 7 KB size
- **Medium state (100 entries)**: 900 µs serialize, 41 KB size
- **Large state (1000 entries)**: 7.7 ms serialize, 375 KB size

**Scaling**: Linear with no performance cliffs

### Thread Lifecycle

- **Single run**: Completes without hanging
- **10 sequential runs**: No thread accumulation
- **20 rapid runs**: No thread leaks detected

**Cleanup**: All threads properly joined or documented as detached

### Arc Reference Counting

- **Pattern**: Strong_count increases during use, returns to baseline after
- **Multiple operations**: No accumulation across pipeline runs
- **Nested usage**: Correctly handled without leaks

**Safety**: No circular references detected

### Channel Backpressure

- **Bounded channels**: Apply backpressure when full (TrySendError::Full)
- **High throughput**: 100 events processed correctly with 50-capacity channel
- **Draining**: Channels drain completely on shutdown

**Pattern**: `sync_channel` (bounded) used for critical paths
