# Custom Lints (dylint)

This repository uses [dylint](https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint) for custom Rust lints.

## Available Lints

| Lint | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `file_too_long` | Warns when a source file exceeds 500 lines (consider refactoring) or 1000 lines (MUST refactor) |

## Running Lints

```bash
# Run all custom lints
cargo dylint --all

# Run a specific lint (recommended: library target only)
make dylint
# or:
cargo dylint -p ralph-workflow --lib file_too_long -- --lib
```

## Developing Lints

Custom lints are in the `lints/` directory. Each lint is a separate crate that compiles to a dynamic library.

To build and test a lint:

```bash
cd lints/file_too_long
cargo +nightly test
```

**Note:** Dylint lints require nightly Rust due to use of rustc internals.

## Environment Variables for Sandboxed Environments

The `make dylint` target respects standard Rust environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CARGO_HOME` | Override cargo cache/bin location | `/tmp/cargo-cache` |
| `RUSTUP_HOME` | Override rustup installation location | `/tmp/rustup-home` |
| `DYLINT_DRIVER_PATH` | Override dylint driver cache location | `/tmp/dylint-drivers` |

For hermetic builds or CI environments with restricted HOME:

```bash
# Example: Run dylint in a sandboxed environment
export CARGO_HOME=/writable/path/cargo
export RUSTUP_HOME=/writable/path/rustup
export DYLINT_DRIVER_PATH=/writable/path/drivers
make dylint
```

## Known Issues

### dylint_driver build failure (v3.5.1 and later)

If you encounter an error like:

```
error: environment variable `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` not defined at compile time
```

This is a known upstream bug in dylint_driver (v3.5.1, v5.0.0, and potentially other versions) that occurs when cargo-dylint rebuilds the driver. The driver build script requires the `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` environment variable to be set at compile time using `env!()`, but cargo-dylint explicitly unsets it when spawning the driver build subprocess (`env -u RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN cargo build`).

### Solution implemented in `make dylint`

The `make dylint` target implements a multi-layered approach intended to ensure the dylint driver is built with the nightly toolchain:

1. **Environment validation:** Checks that CARGO_HOME, RUSTUP_HOME, and DYLINT_DRIVER_PATH are writable
2. **Toolchain bootstrapping:** Installs rustup (if missing) and nightly toolchain with required components (rustc-dev, llvm-tools-preview)
3. **Toolchain discovery:** Dynamically discovers the installed nightly toolchain name (e.g., `nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin`) to support specific nightly versions
4. **Cargo wrapper script:** Creates a temporary wrapper script that exports the discovered nightly toolchain before exec'ing the real nightly cargo
5. **PATH manipulation:** Prepends the wrapper directory and nightly bin directory to PATH, ensuring the wrapper is found first
6. **Environment export:** Exports RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN, RUSTC, and all cache location variables

### How the wrapper works

When cargo-dylint runs `env -u RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN cargo build` to rebuild the driver, it:

1. Unsets RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN in the subprocess environment
2. Searches PATH for the `cargo` binary
3. Finds and executes the wrapper script (first in PATH)
4. Wrapper exports RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN with the dynamically discovered nightly toolchain name
5. Wrapper execs the real nightly cargo with RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN set

This approach works around cargo-dylint's explicit unsetting of RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN, addressing the E0554 failure mode where cargo-dylint rebuilds its driver using a stable toolchain.

### Limitations

This Makefile fix cannot fully eliminate upstream failures where cargo-dylint (or the driver build) requires additional environment variables or pre-provisioned components in strictly offline/sandboxed environments.

## Troubleshooting `make dylint`

### Symptom: E0554 error during dylint driver build

```
error[E0554]: `#![feature]` may not be used on the stable release channel
```

**Cause:** Driver build used stable cargo instead of nightly

**Solution:** Verify nightly toolchain is installed with required components:

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly --profile minimal
rustup component add rustc-dev llvm-tools-preview --toolchain nightly
```

If the issue persists, use the verbose mode to debug PATH resolution:

```bash
make dylint-verbose
```

---

### Symptom: "cannot create required directory" error

```
error: cannot create required directory: /path/to/dir
```

**Cause:** HOME or cache directories are not writable

**Solution:** Set writable locations explicitly:

```bash
export CARGO_HOME=/tmp/cargo
export RUSTUP_HOME=/tmp/rustup
export DYLINT_DRIVER_PATH=/tmp/drivers
make dylint
```

---

### Symptom: Network errors during toolchain/component installation

```
error: failed to install nightly toolchain
```

**Cause:** Offline environment cannot fetch toolchains

**Solution:** Pre-install nightly with components before running make dylint:

```bash
# In an online environment, install required toolchain and components
rustup toolchain install nightly --profile minimal
rustup component add rustc-dev llvm-tools-preview --toolchain nightly

# Install cargo-dylint globally
cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link

# Now `make dylint` will work offline
```

---

### Symptom: "dylint-driver" not found or not functional

```
Warning: command failed: "~/.dylint_drivers/nightly-*/dylint-driver" "-V"
```

**Cause:** Corrupted or mismatched dylint driver cache

**Solution:** Clean the driver cache and rebuild:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.dylint_drivers
make dylint
```

---

### Symptom: Warning about cargo not resolving to wrapper

```
warning: cargo resolves to /usr/local/bin/cargo instead of /tmp/xyz/cargo
Continuing anyway, but this may cause issues...
```

**Cause:** System PATH configuration or shell aliases override the wrapper

**Solution:** Check for shell aliases or functions that override cargo:

```bash
# Check for cargo alias or function
type cargo

# If an alias exists, unalias it temporarily
unalias cargo

# Run make dylint again
make dylint
```

---

### Debugging with dylint-verbose

To see detailed information about PATH, cargo resolution, and toolchain selection:

```bash
make dylint-verbose
```

This will display:

- CARGO_HOME, RUSTUP_HOME, DYLINT_DRIVER_PATH locations
- PATH resolution (first 3 entries)
- Wrapper script path and contents
- Which cargo binary is being used (via `command -v` and `which`)
- RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN, RUSTC, and CARGO environment variables
- Nightly toolchain bin directory location

Use this output to diagnose PATH resolution issues or verify the nightly toolchain is correctly configured.
