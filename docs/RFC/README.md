# Ralph RFCs (Request for Comments)

This directory contains design proposals and incident writeups for significant changes to Ralph.

RFCs are primarily kept for historical context. Even when an RFC is marked "Implemented", the codebase may have evolved since it was written.

For the most up-to-date architecture documentation, prefer:

- `../architecture/pipeline-lifecycle.md`
- `../architecture/event-loop-and-reducers.md`
- `../architecture/effect-system.md`
- `../architecture/streaming-and-parsers.md`

## What is an RFC?

An RFC is a design document that describes a proposed change to Ralph. RFCs are used for:

- Major new features
- Significant architectural changes
- Breaking changes
- Cross-cutting concerns that affect multiple components

## RFC Process

1. **Draft**: Create a new RFC document using the template below
2. **Review**: Share with maintainers and community for feedback
3. **Accepted/Rejected**: Decision made based on discussion
4. **Implemented**: Code changes made according to the RFC
5. **Completed**: RFC marked as implemented

## RFC Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
